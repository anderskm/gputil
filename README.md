# GPUtil
`GPUtil` is a Python module for getting the GPU status from NVIDA GPUs using `nvidia-smi`.
`GPUtil` locates all GPUs on the computer, determines their availablity and returns a ordered list of available GPUs.
Availablity is based upon the current memory consumption and load of each GPU.
The module is written with GPU selection for Deep Learning in mind, but it is not task/library specific and it can be applied to any task, where it may be useful to identify available GPUs.

## Usage

To include `GPUtil` in your Python code, all you hve to do is included it at the beginning of your script:

```python
import GPUtil
```

Once included all functions are available. The functions along with a short description of inputs, outputs and their functionality can be found in the following two sections.

### Main functions

```python
deviceIDs = GPUtil.getAvailable(order = 'first', limit = 1, maxLoad = 0.5, maxMemory = 0.5, includeNan=False, excludeID=[], excludeUUID=[])
```
Returns a list ids of available GPUs. Availablity is determined based on current memory usage and load. The order, maximum number of devices, their maximum load and maximum memory consumption are determined by the input arguments.

* Inputs
  * `order` - Deterimines the order in which the available GPU device ids are returned. `order` should be specified as one of the following strings:
    * `'first'` - orders available GPU device ids by ascending id (**defaut**)
    * `'last'` - orders available GPU device ids by descending id
    * `'random'` - orders the available GPU device ids randomly
    * `'load'`- orders the available GPU device ids by ascending load
    * `'memory'` - orders the available GPU device ids by ascending memory usage
  * `limit` - limits the number of GPU device ids returned to the specified number. Must be positive integer. (**default = 1**)
  * `maxLoad` - Maximum current relative load for a GPU to be considered available. GPUs with a load larger than `maxLoad` is not returned. (**default = 0.5**)
  * `maxMemory` - Maximum current relative memory usage for a GPU to be considered available. GPUs with a current memory usage larger than `maxMemory` is not returned. (**default = 0.5**)
  * `includeNan` - True/false flag indicating whether to include GPUs where either load or memory usage is NaN (indicating usage could not be retrieved). (**default = False**)
  * `excludeID` - List of IDs, which should be excluded from the list of available GPUs. See `GPU` class description. (**default = []**)
  * `excludeUUID` - Same as `excludeID` except it uses the UUID. (**default = []**)
* Outputs
  * deviceIDs - list of all available GPU device ids. A GPU is considered available, if the current load and memory usage is less than `maxLoad` and `maxMemory`, respectively. The list is ordered according to `order`. The maximum number of returned device ids is limited by `limit`.

```python
deviceID = GPUtil.getFirstAvailable(order = 'first', maxLoad=0.5, maxMemory=0.5, attempts=1, interval=900, verbose=False)
```
Returns the first avaiable GPU. Availablity is determined based on current memory usage and load, and the ordering is determined by the specified order.
If no available GPU is found, an error is thrown.
When using the default values, it is the same as `getAvailable(order = 'first', limit = 1, maxLoad = 0.5, maxMemory = 0.5)`

* Inputs
  * `order` - See the description for `GPUtil.getAvailable(...)`
  * `maxLoad` - Maximum current relative load for a GPU to be considered available. GPUs with a load larger than `maxLoad` is not returned. (**default = 0.5**)
  * `maxMemory` - Maximum current relative memory usage for a GPU to be considered available. GPUs with a current memory usage larger than `maxMemory` is not returned. (**default = 0.5**)
  * `attempts` - Number of attempts the function should make before giving up finding an available GPU. (**default = 1**)
  * `interval` - Interval in seconds between each attempt to find an available GPU. (**default = 900** --> 15 mins)
  * `verbose` - If `True`, prints the attempt number before each attempt and the GPU id if an available is found.
  * `includeNan` - See the description for `GPUtil.getAvailable(...)`. (**default = False**)
  * `excludeID` - See the description for `GPUtil.getAvailable(...)`. (**default = []**)
  * `excludeUUID` - See the description for `GPUtil.getAvailable(...)`. (**default = []**)
* Outputs
  * deviceID - list with 1 element containing the first available GPU device ids. A GPU is considered available, if the current load and memory usage is less than `maxLoad` and `maxMemory`, respectively. The order and limit are fixed to `'first'` and `1`, respectively.


```python
GPUtil.showUtilization(all=False, attrList=None, useOldCode=False)
```
Prints the current status (id, memory usage, uuid load) of all GPUs
* Inputs
  * `all` - True/false flag indicating if all info on the GPUs should be shown. Overwrites `attrList`.
  * `attrList` - List of lists of `GPU` attributes to display. See code for more information/example.
  * `useOldCode` - True/false flag indicating if the old code to display GPU utilization should be used.
* Outputs
  * _None_

See [demo_GPUtil.py](https://github.com/anderskm/gputil/blob/master/demo_GPUtil.py) for examples and more details.

## Examples


### Select first available GPU in Caffe
In the Deep Learning library [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/), the user can switch between using the CPU or GPU through their Python interface.
This is done by calling the methods `caffe.set_mode_cpu()` and `caffe.set_mode_gpu()`, respectively.
Below is a minimum working example for selecting the first available GPU with GPUtil to run a Caffe network.

```python
# Import caffe and GPUtil
import caffe
import GPUtil

# Set CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER so the IDs assigned by CUDA match those from nvidia-smi
os.environ["CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER"] = "PCI_BUS_ID"

# Get the first available GPU
DEVICE_ID_LIST = GPUtil.getFirstAvailable()
DEVICE_ID = DEVICE_ID_LIST[0] # grab first element from list

# Select GPU mode
caffe.set_mode_gpu()
# Select GPU id
caffe.set_device(DEVICE_ID)

# Initialize your network here

```

**Note:** At the time of writing this example, the Caffe Python wrapper only supports 1 GPU, although the underlying code supports multiple GPUs.
Calling directly Caffe from the terminal allows for using multiple GPUs.

### Occupy only 1 GPU in TensorFlow
By default, [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)  will occupy all available GPUs when using a gpu as a device (e.g. `tf.device('\gpu:0')`).
By setting the environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, the user can mask which GPUs should be visible to TensorFlow via CUDA (See [CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES - Masking GPUs](http://acceleware.com/blog/cudavisibledevices-masking-gpus)). Using GPUtil.py, the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES can be set programmatically based on the available GPUs.
Below is a minimum working example of how to occupy only 1 GPU in TensorFlow using GPUtil.
To run the code, copy it into a new python file (e.g. `demo_tensorflow_gputil.py`) and run it (e.g. enter `python demo_tensorflow_gputil.py` in a terminal).

**Note:** Even if you set the device you run your code on to a CPU, TensorFlow will occupy all available GPUs. To avoid this, all GPUs can be hidden from TensorFlow with `os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = ''`.

```python
# Import os to set the environment variable CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
import os
import tensorflow as tf
import GPUtil

# Set CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER so the IDs assigned by CUDA match those from nvidia-smi
os.environ["CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER"] = "PCI_BUS_ID"

# Get the first available GPU
DEVICE_ID_LIST = GPUtil.getFirstAvailable()
DEVICE_ID = DEVICE_ID_LIST[0] # grab first element from list

# Set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES to mask out all other GPUs than the first available device id
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = str(DEVICE_ID)

# Since all other GPUs are masked out, the first available GPU will now be identified as GPU:0
device = '/gpu:0'
print('Device ID (unmasked): ' + str(DEVICE_ID))
print('Device ID (masked): ' + str(0))

# Run a minimum working example on the selected GPU
# Start a session
with tf.Session() as sess:
    # Select the device
    with tf.device(device):
        # Declare two numbers and add them together in TensorFlow
        a = tf.constant(12)
        b = tf.constant(30)
        result = sess.run(a+b)
        print('a+b=' + str(result))

```

Your output should look something like the code block below. Notice how only one of the GPUs are found and created as a tensorflow device.

```
Comment the `os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = str(DEVICE_ID)` line and compare the two outputs.
Depending on your number of GPUs, your output should look something like code block below.
Notice, how all 4 GPUs are being found and created as a tensorflow device, whereas when `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` was set, only 1 GPU was found and created.

### Monitor GPU in a separate thread
If using GPUtil to monitor GPUs during training, it may show 0% utilization. A way around this is to use a separate monitoring thread.
```python
import GPUtil
from threading import Thread
import time

class Monitor(Thread):
    def __init__(self, delay):
        super(Monitor, self).__init__()
        self.stopped = False
        self.delay = delay # Time between calls to GPUtil
        self.start()

    def run(self):
        while not self.stopped:
            GPUtil.showUtilization()
            time.sleep(self.delay)

    def stop(self):
        self.stopped = True
        
# Instantiate monitor with a 10-second delay between updates
monitor = Monitor(10)

# Train, etc.

# Close monitor
monitor.stop()
```
